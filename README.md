# Capstone--Arvato-Bertelsmann-Project
Final Capstone Project for Udacity

**Motivation for Project**
- This project is the final 'Capstone' project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree
- Arvato Bertelsmann are a well known company and the reason I chose this specific project is because I thought the data and objective was the most interesting. 
- The requirement of working on both unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning interested me. 

**Libraries used**
- The main libraries used are:
  - numpy: scientific computing tools
  - npandas: data structures and data analysis tools
  - nmatplotlib: data visualisation tools
  - seaborn: data visualisation tools
  - scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine Learning library in Python
  - scipy: data manipulation and visualisation
  - time: different options to represent time

**Repository Files**
- This repository contains the following: 
  - 'Arvato Project Workbook final.ipynb' - Jupyter notebook containing project code
  - 'README.MS' file - the contents you are reading now
  - 'Requirements.txt' - txt file outlining all libraries used 

**Results Summary**
- The following concepts were implemented and covered in the Jupyter notebook:
  - Data Exploration & Cleansing
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - K-means Clustering
  - Supervised Learning
  - Final Model Evaluation between Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Feature Importance showing the top 20 features
